# Java Practice 
I made 3 programs where 2 programs fill in two requirements each while the other program fills in one of the requirements

Conditionals_Loops: So this is a guessing game. Each time the program starts a random number becomes assigned as the secret number the user can guess as many times as they want until they get it correct. Each time they get it wrong the program tells the user that either their guess is lower or higher than the secret number to make it easier for the user to guess the correct number next time.

Character, RPGGame: Two files are needed for this program. The Character file has the class and functions or methods found out that functions is called methods in Java. So Character file stores the class and methods which are the character maker, attack, heal, and checks if its alive which gets called in the RPGGame but you have to run both Character and RPGGame for it to work. RPGGame calls in Character while it also does things such as how the round will go, randomly give stats to the enemy and character, character actions that'll happen, and what will be printed out if you win or lose. User will make a character see the stats for both the character and enemy. They get to type in a action they want to do and after both the user and enemy went it'll show the user both of their statuses untill one of them goes to 0.

Random_Drawing: The program will ask the user to enter as much names as they want for the raffle and once the user types in 'done' the program will randomly pick from the list of people that the user typed in and then announce the winner they got picked.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Download and add the software to visual studio code
2. Make sure that you're in the right place which you can do with ls if you see the file you wanna run then you're good otherwise you're gonna have to use cd and go to where the file is
3. Type in the terminal javac file_name.java this is to compile the file which needs to be done before you can run the program
4. Type in the terminal java file_name

Note: For Character, RPGGame you can just RPGGame since Character will be called in RPGGame so don't have to run Character whatsoever!

Instructions for using the software:

1. Run the program to begin with by following the instructions that are given right above
2. Enter whatever the program tells you to do whether it be a name, number, attack, or heal
3. Be amazed or dissapointed on the program doing what it does mostly printing stuff

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Download from here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* For the RPGGame put in precise stuff like healing that can't go pass the max health or the health can't show negative numbers and instead 0 if attack is higher than the health
* Honestly make the radomization of the enemy and character stats more balanced since it really sucks in my opinion
* Maybe muliple rounds and bosses even for RPGGame with the bosses having it's own unique rules
* Unique events, inventory honestly good idea to show off storage instead of the random drawing but didn't know how much time I would have for it
* I can do like easy, medium, and hard for the guessing number increasing the range of numbers that can be choosen for the secret number the higher the difficulty is
* For the random drawing I would say if the user wants more people to be picked it can be inputted of how much winner there are and then the program picks out randomly that much winners. I think that will be cool.
